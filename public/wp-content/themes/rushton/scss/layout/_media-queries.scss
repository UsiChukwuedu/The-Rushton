/** 

!!! ----- ATTENTION ----- !!! 

We are moving away from traditional media queries.

Instead we prefer using the Foundation breakpoint mixin that can be nested inside of elements.

This greatly inceases efficiency of workflow and organization of the SASS files.

To see exmaples of these in use, look the h1, h2 elements near the top of sitewide.scss

To see or edit the Foundation breakpoints, look inside _settings.scss
